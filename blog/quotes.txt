Buddha is in the heart; the path is now.
Ch'an is the cessation of thoughts; compassion is within wisdom.
.
Helping other's good wishes, the virtue is boundless.
Helping others to complete good deeds, the contribution is multiplied.
.
Treasuring good opportunity you will gain even more good opportunity;
Treasuring causes and conditions you will encounter even more good causes and conditions.
.
Willing to learn and do is capable.
Neither willing to learn nor to do is ignorant.
.
Hope can set your mind to tomorrow;
Action must be carried out today.
.
Ask for cultivating - without expecting harvest; Salute other's work - without seeking self-happiness; Think about giving - without demanding retribution; Aspire to accomplishment - without calculating hard work.
.
